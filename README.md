# SQL Library Manager

## Eighth Treehouse techdegree project. Unit-08
---
Web application that'll include pages to _list, add, update, and delete_ books. A more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

Created with [**node.js**](https://github.com/nodejs), [**express**](https://github.com/expressjs) and SQL ORM [***Sequelize***](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) using middleware, routes, pug templates and SQLite database to accomplish a full functional and dynamic website, where you begin at the landing page with a list of library's collection of books:
![Landing page](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3z5stec/image/upload/v1599235765/Sql%20Library%20Manager/landing_page_g4fs65.png)
At this point you can add a new book: 
![New Book page](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3z5stec/image/upload/v1599236503/Sql%20Library%20Manager/Create_new_book_wgkzsj.png)
At landing page also you can look for more detailed info of each book:
![Book detail page](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3z5stec/image/upload/v1599236302/Sql%20Library%20Manager/book_detail_bsqmdd.png)
Here you can update the book info, showing errors if some field is missing: 
![Updating page](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3z5stec/image/upload/v1599236399/Sql%20Library%20Manager/error_updating_book_wid2rp.png)
Or delete the book: 
![Updating page](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3z5stec/image/upload/v1599236545/Sql%20Library%20Manager/delete_book_ivjolk.png)
At landing page also you can use a search field to find any book for any info set:
![Search book page](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3z5stec/image/upload/v1599236723/Sql%20Library%20Manager/search_books_ex30cc.png)

The project has been configured to use [heroku](https://www.heroku.com) to deploy the app and have it in a live link.
